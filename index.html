                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>Based in Richmond, Virginia, our initiative is to empower local businesses and organizations by creating a platform for them to advertise their business. As a nonprofit organization, we are dedicated to creating professional, custom-built websites at no cost to help small businesses thrive in this digital age. Through this organization, we aim to support our community and assist the growth of these businesses.</p>

                        <p>That means we will create, design, and customize your website to fit your needs.</p>
                        <h2>Why?</h2>
                        <p>We want to help local businesses thrive in this digital age. Right now, many companies fail to reach a higher level due to their lack in websites. After we build a website tailored to your needs and services, consumers will be able to easily reach your company faster and more reliably.

                        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
                        <p>Following the Coronavirus Pandemic in 2020, we realized many businesses shifted to online platforms and used apps to run their businesses. However, many small businesses do not have the knowledge or resources to go online and suffered tragically from the lockdown. As a result, we made it our mission to provide local businesses with custom-made websites to expand their reach and empower their success.</p>
